Midi2FretBoard is a tool for piano players that displays notes from midi keyboard on guitar FretBoard. This allows piano players to easily learn how to play songs that they already know from piano, on new instrument.

If you are piano player and you want to quickly jump into playing guitar without searching for tabs etc, this tool is for you.

I originally wrote it in GoLang when I was starting to play guitar and it was never meant to be published, but it was so useful at the beginning of my guitar journey, that I decided to simplify it and rewrite it in JS and then publish it so maybe someone in the future will find it as useful as it was for me (-:
